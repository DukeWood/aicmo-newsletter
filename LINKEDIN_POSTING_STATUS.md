# LinkedIn Posting Status - Community Management API

## ‚ùå Current Situation

**You CANNOT post to LinkedIn** with your current setup because:

- You have **Development Tier** access (not Standard Tier)
- Development Tier only allows **READ** operations:
  - ‚úÖ Read organization info
  - ‚úÖ Read analytics
  - ‚úÖ OAuth authentication
- Development Tier **blocks** all WRITE operations:
  - ‚ùå Create posts ‚Üí `ACCESS_DENIED: partnerApiPostsExternal.CREATE.20250101`
  - ‚ùå Legacy ugcPosts ‚Üí `ACCESS_DENIED: ugcPosts.CREATE.NO_VERSION`

## üîí Why This Happens

LinkedIn Community Management API has two tiers:

| Feature | Development Tier | Standard Tier |
|---------|------------------|---------------|
| Read organization data | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Read posts/analytics | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **Create posts** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| API call limits | 500/day | Unlimited |

**You currently have:** Development Tier
**You need for posting:** Standard Tier

## ‚úÖ Solution: Apply for Standard Tier

Since you said you **cannot apply for Standard Tier**, you have these options:

### Option A: Manual Posting (Recommended)
Post manually to LinkedIn via the web interface at:
- https://www.linkedin.com/company/108297743/

**Pros:**
- Works immediately
- Full control over formatting
- No API restrictions

**Cons:**
- Not automated
- Requires manual effort

### Option B: Third-Party Tools
Use LinkedIn-approved social media management tools:
- **Buffer** - https://buffer.com
- **Hootsuite** - https://hootsuite.com
- **Sprout Social** - https://sproutsocial.com

These tools have Standard Tier access and can post on your behalf.

### Option C: Wait for Access (If Possible)
If you change your mind about applying:
1. Go to: https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps/225561866/products
2. Click "Request Standard Tier Access"
3. Provide:
   - Screen recording of OAuth working
   - Use case description
   - Expected posting volume
4. Wait 1-3 business days for approval

## üõ†Ô∏è What's Already Built (Ready When You Get Access)

All scripts are ready to use once you get Standard Tier:

```bash
# Simple posting
node scripts/social/post-linkedin-direct.cjs "Your post text"

# Post with image
node scripts/social/post-to-linkedin.cjs image "Caption" ./image.png

# Cross-post newsletter
node scripts/social/cross-post-newsletter.cjs newsletter.md --linkedin
```

## üìä Testing Your Current Access

To verify what you can do right now:

```bash
node scripts/social/linkedin-test-permissions.cjs
```

This will show:
- ‚úÖ What works (read operations)
- ‚ùå What's blocked (write operations)

## ü§î Summary

**Current Reality:**
- Community Management API Development Tier = READ ONLY
- No workaround exists to post with Development Tier
- You must either:
  - Get Standard Tier approval, OR
  - Post manually, OR
  - Use third-party tools

**When you said "I got Community Management API approval":**
- This was Development Tier (automatic/immediate)
- Standard Tier requires separate application (1-3 days)
- Standard Tier is the only way to post via API
