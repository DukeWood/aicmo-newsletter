# A4O Framework Image Generation Guide

## Overview

You requested a professional infographic for the **A4O Framework (AI Marketing Maturity Framework)** optimized for Twitter/X (1200x675px) with aiCMO brand colors.

I've created a script that generates this image using Hugging Face's FLUX.1-schnell AI model (free).

## Troubleshooting

### "Missing Hugging Face token"
**Solution:** Follow Method 1 Step 1-2 above to set up your free token

### "Model is loading" or "Service Unavailable"
**Cause:** Hugging Face models can take 1-2 minutes to load on first request ("cold start")

**Solution:** Wait 2 minutes and try again, or use Method 2 (web interface)

### "Rate limit exceeded"
**Cause:** Free tier has usage limits (~100 images/day)

**Solution:**
- Wait 1 hour and try again
- Use Method 2 (web interface)
- Use Method 3 (ChatGPT-4o)

### Image quality not perfect
**Solution:** Use hybrid workflow:
1. Generate with AI
2. Import to Canva for polish
3. Export via API
