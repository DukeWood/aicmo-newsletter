## ❓ FAQ

### Why single-plan instead of multi-tier?

**Pre-PMF context:** You're creating a new category (GEO), many features are still under development, and you need volume over revenue to validate product-market fit.

**Benefits:**
- **Simplicity:** One decision (Free vs Autopilot) = higher conversions
- **Speed:** Faster learning loops, quicker PMF validation
- **Community:** Founding members become evangelists
- **Flexibility:** Easy to pivot pricing post-PMF

**Risks:**
- Lower revenue short-term (but 6 months faster to PMF)
- Founding members locked at £39 forever (acceptable trade-off)

### Why £49/month instead of £79?

**£49 = impulse buy threshold for B2B SaaS**
- Below £50 = no CFO approval needed
- Matches competitors (Jasper, Copy.ai)
- Above commodity AI writers (£29-39)
- Signals "early adopter pricing, get in now"

**After 500 founding members:**
- Raise to £79/month for new customers
- Founding members keep £39 forever
- Validates willingness to pay higher price

### What if we don't hit 500 in 12 months?

**Contingency plans:**
1. **Month 6:** If <150 members, lower free tier (5 articles instead of 10) to increase paid conversions
2. **Month 9:** If <300 members, increase founding member limit to 750 (extend program)
3. **Month 12:** If <400 members, keep founding member pricing until 500 reached (don't raise prices yet)

**Key:** 500 is a goal, not a deadline. PMF matters more than arbitrary numbers.

### When do we launch add-ons?

**Not until Month 6-9** (after core value validated)

**Only add when customers ask 10+ times:**
- +50 articles/month (£19)
- +1 brand slot (£15/brand/month)
- Priority support (£15/month)

**Bundles at Month 9:**
- Growth Bundle (£69)
- SEO Power Bundle (£79)

### How do we handle feature requests from non-founding members?

**Priority order:**
1. Founding members (private Slack, beta access)
2. Paying customers (email support, public roadmap votes)
3. Free users (community forum, upvote existing requests)

**Founding members shape roadmap, others get polished features.**
