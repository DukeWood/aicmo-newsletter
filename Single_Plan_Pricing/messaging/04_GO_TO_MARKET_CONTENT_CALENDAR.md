**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Goal:** 500 founding members in 12 months
**Strategy:** Founder-led content + community infiltration + category education

---

## Core Messaging Framework

### The Big Idea

**"Google search is dying. AI is taking over. If you're not in AI answers, you're invisible."**

### Positioning Statement

aiCMO is the first GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) platform that helps brands show up in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude answers—not just Google search. We automate content creation and publishing so AI engines learn who you are and recommend you first.

### Target Audience (First 500)

**Primary:**
- **SaaS founders** (10-50 employees, seed to Series A)
- **Marketing consultants** (solopreneurs, building personal brand)
- **Content-first agencies** (1-3 clients, looking for competitive edge)

**Psychographics:**
- Early adopters (comfortable with AI tools)
- Frustrated with SEO rat race
- Understand Google's declining relevance
- Want autopilot marketing
- Budget-conscious but willing to pay for value

**Pain Points:**
1. "SEO is a hamster wheel—Google keeps changing rules"
2. "I'm invisible in ChatGPT/Perplexity search results"
3. "Content creation takes 20+ hours/week"
4. "My competitors show up in AI answers, I don't"
5. "I don't know how to optimize for AI engines"

### Value Propositions (Ranked)

**1. Future-Proof Visibility**
"Show up in AI answers, not just Google links."

**2. Set-and-Forget Automation**
"Autopilot publishes 50 articles + 100 posts monthly. You review, we execute."

**3. Early Mover Advantage**
"Lock in £39/month forever as a founding member (before we raise to £79)."

**4. GEO Expertise**
"We're the first platform built for AI search optimization."

### Messaging Pillars

| Pillar | What We Say | Why It Matters |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **GEO > SEO** | "SEO optimizes for Google. GEO optimizes for AI engines like ChatGPT." | Differentiation, category creation |
| **Autopilot** | "Set your brand voice once. We publish 50 articles/month automatically." | Saves time, removes friction |
| **Founding Member** | "First 500 lock in £39/month forever. After that: £79." | Urgency, FOMO, scarcity |
| **AI-First** | "Built for the AI era, not the Google era." | Forward-looking, visionary |

## Content Templates

### Twitter Thread Template (GEO Education)

```
Tweet 1 (Hook):
Google search is dying. AI is taking over.

71% of Americans now use ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Claude for research.

If you're not in AI answers, you're invisible to 7 in 10 customers.

Here's how to fix it: 🧵

Tweet 2 (Problem):
Traditional SEO optimizes for Google's 10 blue links.

But AI engines don't show links—they give direct answers.

Your brand needs to be IN the answer, not just linked at the bottom.

That's where GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) comes in.

Tweet 3 (Solution):
GEO = SEO for AI engines.

Instead of keywords and backlinks, GEO focuses on:
• Brand voice clarity
• Contextual authority
• AI-readable content structure
• Answer-optimized formatting

Goal: Teach AI who you are so it recommends YOU first.

Tweet 4 (How-To):
5 GEO tactics that work:

1. Publish 50+ brand-focused articles (teach AI your story)
2. Use question-based titles (match AI query patterns)
3. Include competitor comparisons (differentiate yourself)
4. Add structured data (schema.org for AI parsers)
5. Update content frequently (fresh = relevant)

Tweet 5 (Tool Plug):
This is why we built @aiCMO.

Autopilot publishing: 50 articles + 100 posts/month
GEO-optimized: Designed for ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude
Set & forget: You configure once, we execute monthly

First 500 lock in £39/month forever → [link]

Tweet 6 (CTA):
If you're a founder, consultant, or agency:

You need GEO, not just SEO.

Join 153 founding members already optimizing for AI search.

347 spots left at £39/month (then £79).

Claim yours: [link]

Tweet 7 (Social Proof):
RT from the top if you're betting on AI search over Google.

More GEO content coming this week:
• Follow @yourhandle for daily tips
• Join our free Slack: [link]
• Read the full guide: [link]
```

### LinkedIn Post Template (Thought Leadership)

```
HEADLINE:
Google search is dying. Are you ready for the AI search era?

BODY:
I've been in marketing for 15 years. SEO was my bread and butter.

But in the last 18 months, something fundamental shifted:

My customers stopped Googling. They started asking ChatGPT.

Here's the data:
• 71% of Americans now use AI for research (Stanford, 2024)
• ChatGPT processes 100M+ queries daily
• Perplexity grew 300% YoY in searches
• Google's market share dropped from 90% to 60% among Gen Z

This isn't a trend. It's a tectonic shift.

THE PROBLEM:
Traditional SEO optimizes for Google's 10 blue links.

AI engines don't show links—they give direct answers.

If your brand isn't IN the AI's answer, you're invisible.

THE SOLUTION:
GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) = SEO for AI engines.

Instead of keywords and backlinks, GEO focuses on:
✓ Brand voice clarity (teach AI who you are)
✓ Contextual authority (become the go-to source)
✓ AI-readable structure (schema, structured data)
✓ Answer-optimized content (match AI query patterns)

WHY THIS MATTERS:
In 3 years, 80% of searches will happen on AI platforms.

The brands that win will be the ones AI trusts and recommends.

Early movers (like you?) will dominate their categories.

Laggards will fight for scraps.

WHAT I'M DOING ABOUT IT:
I built aiCMO—the first GEO platform for founders and agencies.

Autopilot publishing: 50 articles + 100 posts/month, optimized for ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude.

We're onboarding our first 500 founding members at £39/month (locked in forever).

After that, the price goes to £79/month.

153 spots claimed. 347 left.

## What is GEO?

GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) is the practice of optimizing your brand and content to rank in AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude.

Unlike traditional SEO (which optimizes for Google's link-based results), GEO focuses on teaching AI engines to understand your brand story, differentiate you from competitors, and recommend you directly in conversational answers.

**Example:**

- **SEO goal:** Rank #1 in Google for "project management software"
- **GEO goal:** Be the software ChatGPT recommends when asked "What's the best project management tool for remote teams?"

---

## Why GEO Matters in 2025

### The Shift from Google to AI

The way people search is fundamentally changing:

| Year | Google Market Share | AI Search (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.) |
|------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 2020 | 90% | 2% |
| 2023 | 75% | 15% |
| 2025 | 60% (est.) | 30% (est.) |
| 2027 | 40% (est.) | 50% (est.) |

**Source:** Stanford Internet Observatory, Pew Research, SimilarWeb

### What This Means for Your Brand

**If you're only doing SEO:**
- You're optimizing for a shrinking audience
- You're invisible to the 30-40% using AI search
- Your competitors who do GEO will steal your market share

**If you're doing GEO:**
- You're future-proofing your visibility
- You're capturing the fastest-growing search segment
- You're building contextual authority that compounds

---

## GEO vs SEO: Key Differences

| Dimension | SEO (Traditional) | GEO (AI Search) |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Platform** | Google, Bing | ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude |
| **Result Format** | 10 blue links | Direct conversational answer |
| **Optimization Goal** | Rank in top 3 links | Be IN the AI's answer |
| **Key Ranking Factors** | Keywords, backlinks, page speed | Brand clarity, contextual authority, structured data |
| **Content Strategy** | Keyword-targeted blog posts | Brand-focused, FAQ-style, comparative content |
| **Measurement** | Click-through rate, bounce rate | Brand mention rate, recommendation frequency |

---

## How GEO Works

AI engines like ChatGPT and Perplexity recommend brands based on:

### 1. Training Data
AI models are trained on massive text datasets (books, articles, websites, forums).

If your brand has strong, consistent presence in these datasets, AI "knows" you.

**GEO tactic:** Publish 50+ high-quality articles across your website, Medium, LinkedIn, and niche forums.

### 2. Contextual Authority
AI prioritizes sources it deems authoritative for specific queries.

Authority comes from:
- Depth of content (comprehensive guides, case studies)
- Consistency (frequent publishing on your niche)
- Differentiation (clear positioning vs competitors)

**GEO tactic:** Create in-depth, answer-style content that addresses user intent directly.

### 3. Structured Data
AI engines can parse structured data (schema.org, JSON-LD) more effectively than unstructured HTML.

**GEO tactic:** Add schema markup for Organization, Product, FAQ, HowTo, Article.

### 4. Real-Time Indexing (For Perplexity, Bing Chat)
Some AI engines crawl the web in real-time and cite recent sources.

**GEO tactic:** Publish frequently (weekly minimum) to stay in real-time indexes.

---

## 7 GEO Tactics That Work

### 1. Publish Brand-Focused Content

**Goal:** Teach AI who you are.

**How:**
- Write "What is [Your Brand]?" guide
- Create "[Your Brand] vs Competitors" comparison pages
- Build FAQ page answering common questions
- Publish founder story, mission, values

**Example:** If you're a SaaS, publish "What is [Your SaaS]? Complete Guide" optimized for AI search.

### 2. Use Question-Based Titles

**Goal:** Match AI query patterns.

**How:**
AI users ask natural language questions:
- "What's the best [category] for [use case]?"
- "How do I [achieve outcome]?"
- "Why is [Your Brand] better than [Competitor]?"

Title your content to match these patterns.

**Example:**
- ❌ "Feature Update: New Dashboard"
- ✅ "How to Track Marketing ROI with [Your Brand]'s New Dashboard"

### 3. Add Competitor Comparisons

**Goal:** Differentiate yourself.

**How:**
- Create "[Your Brand] vs [Competitor]" pages
- Include honest pros/cons (builds trust)
- Focus on your unique differentiation

**Why:** AI engines often present multiple options. Comparative content increases your chance of being mentioned alongside (or instead of) competitors.

### 4. Use Structured Data

**Goal:** Help AI parse your content.

**How:**
Add schema.org markup:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Your Brand",
  "description": "One-sentence description",
  "url": "https://yourbrand.com",
  "logo": "https://yourbrand.com/logo.png",
  "foundingDate": "2024",
  "founders": [
    {
      "@type": "Person",
      "name": "Founder Name"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Publish Frequently

**Goal:** Stay fresh in real-time AI indexes.

**How:**
- Publish 10+ articles/month minimum
- Update existing content quarterly
- Maintain active blog, social media, forums

**Why:** Freshness signals relevance. AI engines prioritize recent, updated sources.

### 6. Optimize for Voice Queries

**Goal:** Match conversational AI queries.

**How:**
- Use natural language (not keyword-stuffed)
- Write in second person ("you," "your")
- Answer questions directly (TLDR at top)
- Use bullet points, numbered lists (scannable)

### 7. Build Contextual Authority

**Goal:** Become THE go-to source in your niche.

**How:**
- Publish 50+ in-depth articles on your topic
- Guest post on authoritative sites (Forbes, Medium, niche blogs)
- Engage in Reddit, Quora, niche forums (leave breadcrumbs)
- Earn mentions from respected sources

**Why:** AI engines trust brands with consistent, deep expertise.

The brands that win in the AI era will be those AI engines trust, understand, and recommend first.

## Community Engagement Scripts

### Indie Hackers Post

**Title:** "Launched aiCMO on Product Hunt today. 23 founding members in 12 hours. Here's what I learned."

**Body:**

Hit #3 Product of the Day on PH this morning.

aiCMO = GEO platform (think SEO for ChatGPT/Perplexity).

**What worked:**

1. **Founder-led content for 30 days pre-launch**
   - Posted daily GEO tips on Twitter
   - Built 500-person waitlist

2. **Founding member pricing (scarcity)**
   - £39/month locked forever (first 500)
   - After that: £79/month
   - Created urgency without being scammy

3. **Category education > product pitch**
   - "Google search is dying" resonated more than "Try aiCMO"
   - Positioned GEO as inevitable trend

**What didn't work:**

1. **Over-explaining features**
   - Nobody cares about "autopilot publishing"
   - They care about "show up in ChatGPT answers"

2. **Launching on a Friday**
   - Weekend traffic lower than expected
   - Should've launched Tuesday/Wednesday

**Metrics (Day 1):**
- 23 paying customers (£39/month each)
- 547 MRR
- 2,341 website visitors
- 67 sign-ups (43% conversion to trial)

**Next steps:**
- Double down on Twitter (daily threads)
- Reach 50 founding members by end of week
- Start podcast tour next month

**Questions:**

1. How did you price your MVP?
2. What's your founder-led content strategy?
3. Have you thought about GEO for YOUR product?

Happy to answer anything! 👇
