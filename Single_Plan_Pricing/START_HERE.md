## 📞 Questions Before Moving Forward?

**Common questions:**

**Q: "I don't have a designer. Should I delay launch?"**
A: No. Use Tailwind UI components. Launch with "good enough" design. Founding members care more about value than pixel-perfect design.

**Q: "I'm not technical. Can I still launch in 7 weeks?"**
A: Yes, but you MUST hire a developer. Budget £5K-8K minimum. Interview 3-5 candidates this week.

**Q: "What if I only have £2K budget?"**
A: DIY everything. Use no-code tools (Webflow + Airtable + Zapier) for MVP. Trade time for money.

**Q: "Do I need all features at launch?"**
A: No. See "Critical Path" in EXECUTION_ROADMAP.md. You can launch with just: pricing page + sign-up + onboarding + article generation. Everything else can come post-launch.

**Q: "What if no one signs up?"**
A: That's why you're building waitlist first. If you can't get 100+ waitlist subscribers in 4 weeks, your positioning needs work. Fix messaging before building product.
