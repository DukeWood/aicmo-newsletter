## DISCOUNT PSYCHOLOGY & MESSAGING

### Why Time-Limited Discounts Work
1. **Urgency:** Countdown timers trigger loss aversion (FOMO)
2. **Scarcity:** Limited redemptions (Tier 1) increase perceived value
3. **Anchoring:** 40% discount anchors expectations, making 30% feel reasonable
4. **Regret Prevention:** "I'll never get this offer again" drives action

### Messaging Best Practices
**DO:**
- Frame discount as "founder's gratitude" not desperation
- Emphasize value-adds (Inner Circle, bonus content) not just price reduction
- Show clear savings: "£158/mo → £95/mo (save £189 over 3 months)"
- Use social proof: "8 of 20 spots claimed" creates bandwagon effect

**DON'T:**
- Say "limited time offer" without specific deadline
- Extend deadlines (damages trust + future campaigns)
- Discount below 40% (devalues product long-term)
- Offer discounts to non-LDF25 users (creates fairness issues)

---

## ANTI-FRAUD & ABUSE PREVENTION

### Safeguards
1. **Code Validation:** Each code tied to specific email domain/user (if possible via CRM)
2. **Redemption Limits:** LDF25-EARLY capped at 20 uses (prevents gaming)
3. **No Code Stacking:** Users can't combine LDF25-EARLY + referral code
4. **IP Tracking:** Flag suspicious redemptions (e.g., 10 upgrades from same IP)
5. **Manual Review:** Peter reviews all OUTREACH upgrades (higher value = higher scrutiny)

### What If Someone Games The System?
**Scenario:** User creates 5 accounts to claim 5× LDF25-EARLY discounts
**Response:**
- Peter flags duplicate payment methods/IP addresses
- Jason personally reviews flagged accounts
- Legitimate accounts approved; fraudulent accounts refunded + banned
- Update CRM to prevent future abuse

---

## POST-DISCOUNT PRICING STRATEGY

### What Happens After Month 3?
**Month 4+:** All users revert to standard pricing (£158/mo MOMENTUM, £298/mo OUTREACH)

**Churn Prevention:**
- Email on Day 60 (before standard pricing kicks in): "Reminder: Your discount ends next month. Here's why you should stay..."
- Showcase results from months 1-3 (articles published, AI citations, traffic increase)
- Offer annual billing option (save 20%) to retain users
- Personal check-in from Jason/Sophie for high-value OUTREACH users

**Churn Recovery:**
- If user cancels after month 3, offer "Win-Back" discount: 15% off for 3 more months
- Conduct exit survey: "Why are you leaving? What would make you stay?"
- Tag churned users as "LDF25-CHURNED" for future re-engagement campaigns

---

## DISCOUNT APPROVAL & GOVERNANCE

**Approvers:**
- Jason (CEO) - final approval on discount structure
- Peter (Performance) - financial modeling & revenue impact
- Emily (Email) - integration with nurture sequence

**Change Management:**
- Any changes to discount tiers require Jason's approval
- Emergency adjustments (e.g., extending deadline due to technical issue) require Peter + Jason sign-off
- Post-campaign review to assess: Did discounts drive conversions? Did they damage brand perception?

## COMPETITIVE BENCHMARKING

**How do our discounts compare to competitors?**

| Competitor | Typical Discount | Duration | Eligibility |
|------------|------------------|----------|-------------|
| HubSpot | 20-30% off | 3-6 months | Event attendees |
| SEMrush | 14-day free trial + 20% off | First year | All users |
| Jasper AI | 10,000 bonus credits | One-time | New users |
| **aiCMO (LDF25)** | **40% → 30% → 20%** | **First 3 months** | **Event attendees** |

**Our Advantage:**
- Higher discount (40% vs industry 20-30%)
- Tiered urgency creates multiple conversion windows
- Value-adds (Inner Circle) differentiate from pure price discounts
