## RISKS & MITIGATIONS

### Risk 1: Low Email Engagement (Open Rate <25%)
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** High
**Mitigation:**
- A/B test subject lines for Email 1 (Emily)
- Send from Jason's personal email for hot leads (authenticity)
- Re-send to non-openers with different subject line after 48 hours
- Use WhatsApp as backup channel for hot leads (Sophie)

### Risk 2: Discount Fatigue / Price Anchoring Too Low
**Likelihood:** Low | **Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Frame discount as "founder's gratitude" not desperation
- Emphasize value-adds (Inner Circle, bonus content) over price
- Tier discounts by time/engagement to reward early action
- Clearly communicate standard pricing resumes after discount period

### Risk 3: Unclear Value Proposition (CATALYST Users Don't Upgrade)
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Email 2 features detailed case study showing CATALYST → MOMENTUM results
- Email 5 includes ROI calculator demonstrating cost savings
- WhatsApp showcases real-time MOMENTUM user wins
- Offer 14-day free trial of MOMENTUM for hesitant hot leads

### Risk 4: Attribution Gaps (Can't Prove Revenue from LDF25)
**Likelihood:** Low | **Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Unique discount codes for each tier (Peter)
- Custom CRM field "Event Source: LDF25" for all conversions
- UTM parameters on all email/social links
- Manual founder outreach for hot leads = direct attribution

### Risk 5: Low Attendee List Quality (Tire-Kickers, Not Buyers)
**Likelihood:** Medium | **Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Lead scoring prioritizes engaged attendees (Mark)
- Separate nurture track for cold leads (Emily: 3 emails max)
- Focus resources on hot/warm segments (80/20 rule)
- Use cold leads for long-term brand awareness, not immediate conversion

**Tactical Execution:**
