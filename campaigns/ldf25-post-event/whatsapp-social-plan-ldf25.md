We're excited to continue this journey with you ‚Äî let's make sure every next-gen brand gets understood, trusted, and cited by AI üöÄ
```

**Day 2 (Oct 8) - Tuesday Afternoon:**
```
Quick question for the group:

What was your biggest "aha moment" from Friday's session?

For me (Sophie here üëã), it was realizing that ChatGPT is already answering 100M+ queries per day. That's HUGE for brand visibility.

What clicked for you?
```

**Day 3 (Oct 9) - Wednesday 12pm:**
```
üéØ ASK MAGGIE ANYTHING - LIVE Q&A

Jason (our CEO) is joining us for 30 minutes to answer any questions about GEO, aiCMO, or AI-first marketing.

No question is too basic or too advanced. Fire away!

[Live Q&A happens in real-time for 30 mins]
```

**Day 4 (Oct 10) - Thursday Morning:**
```
üí° GEO TIP OF THE DAY

Want to get cited by ChatGPT? Add a TL;DR section to the top of every blog post.

AI systems LOVE concise summaries. They're 3x more likely to quote content with clear TL;DRs.

Try it this week and let us know how it goes!
```

**Day 5 (Oct 11) - Friday Afternoon:**
```
üì∏ EVENT PHOTOS ARE HERE!

üéâ FIRST WIN ALERT

Shoutout to Tom (if he gives permission to share) who just got his FIRST ChatGPT citation this week!

He wrote one article using our GEO framework from Friday's session, and ChatGPT quoted it 3 days later.

This is what happens when you optimize for AI-first discovery üöÄ

Who else has wins to share?
```

**Day 14 (Oct 20) - Sunday Evening:**
```
üí° SUNDAY STRATEGY TIP

If you're on CATALYST (our free plan), here's a quick hack to maximize your 30 articles/month:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Focus on ONE topic cluster (e.g., "sustainable fashion tips")
2Ô∏è‚É£ Let Maggie generate 30 related articles around that cluster
3Ô∏è‚É£ Publish consistently (1 per day)

Depth > breadth. Own ONE topic before expanding.

Try it this week!

```

**Day 28 (Nov 3) - Sunday Evening:**
```
üí° EMMA'S STRATEGY (from yesterday's post)

Here's exactly what Emma did to get those results:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Topic clustering: Focused on 5 core themes (not random topics)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Consistency: Published daily (not in batches)
3Ô∏è‚É£ GEO optimization: Every article had TL;DR + FAQs
4Ô∏è‚É£ Distribution: Shared on LinkedIn + X + email newsletter
5Ô∏è‚É£ AI testing: Asked ChatGPT/Gemini her target queries weekly

You can replicate this on MOMENTUM (500 articles/month) or OUTREACH (1,000 articles/month).

Questions? Drop them below.

### ENGAGEMENT TACTICS

#### 1. Weekly "Ask Maggie Anything" Live Q&A
**Schedule:** Every Wednesday, 12:00 PM GMT
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes
**Format:**
- Sophie posts announcement 10 minutes before
- Jason (or designated team member) joins group
- Community members ask questions in real-time
- Jason answers directly in thread
- Sophie summarizes top 3 takeaways afterward

**Sample Questions to Seed:**
- "How long does it take to get my first ChatGPT citation?"
- "What's the difference between GEO and SEO?"
- "Can I use aiCMO if I already have a content team?"
- "How do I measure AI citation share?"

---

#### 2. Daily GEO Tips (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
**Purpose:** Provide bite-sized actionable advice
**Format:** 2-3 sentences + emoji + optional link

**Sample Tips:**
- "Add FAQs to every article - AI loves Q&A formats"
- "Use numbered lists - they're 5x more likely to be cited"
- "Include 'According to [Source]' citations - builds trust with AI"
- "Test your content: Ask ChatGPT your target query and see if you appear"
- "Optimize for voice search - AI answers are often read aloud"

---

#### 3. Member Spotlights (Weekly)
**Purpose:** Celebrate community wins, build social proof
**Format:** Tag member (with permission) + share their result + optional screenshot

**Criteria for Spotlights:**
- Got first AI citation
- Upgraded to paid plan
- Published 100+ articles in first month
- Referred another member to group
- Asked great question in Q&A

---

#### 4. Conversion Touchpoints (Strategic)
**When:** Aligned with email campaign (Email 4 on Oct 17, Email 7 on Nov 6)
**Format:** Soft mention of discount + link + "DM me if you have questions"

**Example (Oct 21 - Discount Expiration Day):**
```
‚è∞ REMINDER: Your 30% LDF25 discount expires TONIGHT

If you're considering upgrading, today's the deadline for 30% off.

Questions? DM me or ask in the group - happy to help you decide.
```

**DO NOT:**
- Post daily discount reminders (feels spammy)
- Pressure members to upgrade
- Make the group feel like a sales funnel

**DO:**
- Mention discount 2-3 times total (aligned with email deadlines)
- Frame as "helpful reminder" not "last chance urgency"
- Offer personal support via DM for hesitant members

---

#### 5. Polls & Engagement Bait (Bi-Weekly)
**Purpose:** Increase engagement, gather insights
**Format:** Simple question with emoji reactions or text replies

**Sample Polls:**
- "What's your biggest marketing challenge right now?"
- "How many articles do you publish per month?"
- "Which AI tool do you use most? (ChatGPT / Gemini / Claude / Other)"
- "What content format performs best for you? (Blogs / Social / Videos / Email)"

---

### MODERATION GUIDELINES

**Sophie's Role as Community Manager:**
- Welcome new members within 24 hours
- Respond to questions within 4 hours (business hours)
- Remove spam or off-topic posts
- Encourage quiet members to participate (DM them directly)

#### POST 9 (Oct 29) - Founder Story
**Format:** Text-only (personal)
**Tone:** Vulnerable + visionary

```
Why we built aiCMO (a founder story)

Two years ago, I was manually writing blog posts for our startup.

It took 6 hours per post. I could only publish 2-3 per month.

Then ChatGPT launched. Suddenly, people stopped Googling and started asking AI.

I realized: If ChatGPT doesn't know my brand, I'm invisible.

So I built aiCMO - an AI marketing OS that:
‚Ä¢ Publishes 100% human-like content at scale
‚Ä¢ Optimizes for both Google AND ChatGPT
‚Ä¢ Tracks when AI systems cite your brand

We launched at Leeds Digital Festival last week. 75 founders showed up.

Some are already getting their first AI citations.

This is the future of marketing. And we're just getting started.

If you're building a next-gen brand, let's build it together.
