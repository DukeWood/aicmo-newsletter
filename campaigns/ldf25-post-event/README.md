## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q: Why 3 discount tiers instead of 1?
**A:** Creates multiple conversion windows (early birds, standard attendees, latecomers), maximizes urgency while maintaining fairness, tests price sensitivity for future events.

### Q: Why is LDF25-EARLY limited to Hot leads?
**A:** Rewards high-intent attendees who showed up + engaged, creates exclusivity ("first 20 only"), higher conversion likelihood justifies deeper discount.

### Q: What if someone misses all deadlines?
**A:** LDF25-COMMUNITY (20% off) is evergreen—available indefinitely for all LDF25 registrants. No one is locked out.

### Q: How do we prevent discount code abuse?
**A:** LDF25-EARLY capped at 20 uses, codes tied to specific email domains (if possible), Peter reviews high-value OUTREACH upgrades, IP tracking flags suspicious activity.

### Q: What happens after Month 3 (when discount ends)?
**A:** Users revert to standard pricing (£158/mo MOMENTUM, £298/mo OUTREACH). Email sent Day 60 showcasing results + offering annual billing (save 20%) to retain users.

### Q: Why WhatsApp instead of Slack or Discord?
**A:** Event already established WhatsApp group, lower friction (attendees already have app), more personal/conversational, higher engagement rates for community-style groups.

### Q: Can users upgrade mid-campaign (e.g., MOMENTUM → OUTREACH)?
**A:** Yes. Contact Jason or Sophie for custom upgrade path. Discount applies to new plan level.

### Q: What if we don't hit 8 conversions (minimum target)?
**A:** Post-campaign retrospective (Dec 15) analyzes why: lead quality, messaging, timing, discount strategy, product-market fit. Findings inform future event strategy.

## CAMPAIGN PHILOSOPHY

This campaign is built on three core beliefs:

1. **Education Over Selling:** We teach GEO, share wins, and build community. Sales happen naturally when people see value.

2. **Gratitude Over Greed:** Discounts are thank-you gifts for attendees who showed up, not desperate price-slashing.

3. **Community Over Customers:** We're building long-term relationships with next-gen founders, not just extracting short-term revenue.

**Success is measured in conversions, but also in:**
- Trust built
- Community strengthened
- Knowledge shared
- Future ambassadors created

Let's make every next-gen brand discoverable by AI.

— Maggie, aiCMO
