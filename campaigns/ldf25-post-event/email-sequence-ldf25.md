### Subject Line A/B Test:

**Subject:** How Sarah scaled from 30 to 500 articles/month (in 14 days)

Hi [First Name],

I'm Maggie - your AI CMO. We met briefly at Leeds Digital Festival last Friday.

I wanted to share a story that might resonate with you.

**Meet Sarah Chen** - a solopreneur running a sustainable fashion consultancy in Manchester. Before aiCMO, she was stuck in the content hamster wheel:
- Writing 1-2 blog posts per month (manually)
- Zero visibility on ChatGPT or Gemini
- Spending 6 hours per week on SEO (with minimal results)

Sound familiar?

Sarah started on our **CATALYST plan** (free forever) to test the waters. Within 2 weeks, she saw:
- 28 articles published (all SEO + GEO optimized)
- First ChatGPT citation of her brand
- 3 inbound leads from AI-generated search

So she upgraded to **MOMENTUM**.

**Here's what happened in the next 30 days:**
- 500 articles published across 12 topic clusters
- 47 AI citations (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude combined)
- 18% increase in organic traffic
- 12 qualified leads (5 converted to paying clients)
- ROI: £4,800 in new revenue from £158/month investment

**That's a 30x return in month one.**

Sarah's secret? She stopped writing and started directing. She set the vision, Maggie executed at scale.

You can do the same.

**If you missed our 40% flash sale, you still have time:**
Use code **LDF25-STANDARD** for **30% off MOMENTUM or OUTREACH** (valid until October 21).

**[CTA: Read Sarah's Full Case Study]** → ai.cmo.so/case-studies/sarah-chen

**[CTA: Upgrade to MOMENTUM (30% Off)]** → ai.cmo.so/ldf25/momentum?code=LDF25-STANDARD

Not ready yet? That's okay. Stay on CATALYST and keep experimenting. I'll keep publishing your 30 articles/month and we'll check in again soon.

To your AI-powered growth,
Maggie
Your AI CMO

## EMAIL 3: GEO DEEP DIVE + FEATURE SPOTLIGHT
**Send Date:** October 14, 2025, 2:00 PM GMT
**Segment:** All (Hot + Warm)
**Sender:** Jason Xu <jason@ai.cmo.so>

### Subject Line A/B Test:

- **Variant B:** See when ChatGPT recommends your brand (AI citation tracking)

**Subject:** [LDF25] The feature we didn't have time to demo on Friday

Hi [First Name],

At Leeds Digital Festival, we covered a lot in 90 minutes - GEO vs SEO, AI-first marketing, Maggie's autonomous content engine.

But there's one feature I ran out of time to show you. And it's honestly the one I'm most excited about:

**AI Citation Tracking.**

Here's the problem most founders face:
- You publish content (blogs, articles, social posts)
- You hope Google indexes it
- You pray ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude read it
- **But you have no idea if AI systems are actually recommending your brand**

It's a black box.

Until now.

With **MOMENTUM** or **OUTREACH**, you get real-time tracking of:
- How many times AI systems cite your brand
- Which queries trigger your brand mention
- Which AI platforms (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity) recommend you most
- Your "AI Share of Voice" compared to competitors

**It's like Google Analytics, but for the AI-first world.**

Here's a live example:

[Screenshot: AI Citation Dashboard showing "Your brand was cited 47 times this week across ChatGPT (28), Gemini (12), Claude (7)"]

This is data you literally cannot get anywhere else. We built it because we needed it ourselves.

Want to see it in action for your brand?

**[CTA: Upgrade to MOMENTUM (30% Off)]** → ai.cmo.so/ldf25/momentum?code=LDF25-STANDARD

Remember: Your **30% LDF25 discount** expires **October 21**. After that, it drops to 20%.

Let me know if you have questions. I read every reply.

Jason
Co-founder & CEO, aiCMO

P.S. If you're still on the fence, reply with "ROI" and I'll send you our interactive ROI calculator. It shows exactly how much time and money you'll save with MOMENTUM vs doing it manually.

**Subject:** [LDF25] 4 days left: 30% off ends Monday

Hi [First Name],

Quick reminder: Your **30% LDF25 discount** expires in **4 days** (Monday, October 21 at 11:59 PM GMT).

If you've been thinking about upgrading from CATALYST to MOMENTUM or OUTREACH, now is the time.

**Here's what you're missing right now:**

**On CATALYST (Free):**
- 30 articles/month
- No AI citation tracking
- No website embedding
- Email support (7-day response)

**On MOMENTUM (£158/mo → £111/mo with LDF25-STANDARD):**
- 500 articles/month (16x more content)
- AI citation tracking (see when ChatGPT mentions you)
- Website embedding + live chat
- Brand knowledge base (coming soon)

**On OUTREACH (£298/mo → £209/mo with LDF25-STANDARD):**
- 1,000 articles + 100 social posts/month
- Content calendar + email marketing integration
- Priority support + quarterly strategy audits
- Dedicated account manager

**The math:**
- Freelance writer: £50-£100 per article → 500 articles = £25,000-£50,000/month
- aiCMO MOMENTUM: £111/month (with your discount)

**You save 99.5% on content production costs.**

**[CTA: Upgrade to MOMENTUM (30% Off)]** → ai.cmo.so/ldf25/momentum?code=LDF25-STANDARD

**[CTA: Upgrade to OUTREACH (30% Off)]** → ai.cmo.so/ldf25/outreach?code=LDF25-STANDARD

After October 21, your discount drops to 20% (and you lose access to Maggie's Inner Circle bonus).

Don't leave money on the table.

To your growth,
Maggie
Your AI CMO

## EMAIL 5: OBJECTION HANDLING + FAQ + ROI CALCULATOR
**Send Date:** October 21, 2025, 10:00 AM GMT

**Sender:** Jason Xu <jason@ai.cmo.so>

### Subject Line A/B Test:
- **Variant A:** [LDF25] "I'm not sure aiCMO is right for me"
- **Variant B:** Last day for 30% off - let me answer your questions

### Email Body:

**Subject:** [LDF25] "I'm not sure aiCMO is right for me"

Hi [First Name],

Your **30% LDF25 discount** expires **tonight at 11:59 PM GMT**.

I noticed you've been opening my emails but haven't upgraded yet. That usually means one of three things:

**1. "I'm not sure AI-generated content will rank on Google or sound human."**

Fair concern. Here's the truth:
- Our content passes all AI detection tools (Originality.ai, GPTZero, Copyleaks)
- We use a 7-stage humanization process (fact-checking, tone alignment, E-E-A-T optimization)
- Average customer sees 18-24% traffic increase within 90 days

**2. "I'm worried about budget/ROI."**

I get it. Let me show you the numbers:

**[CTA: Use Our Interactive ROI Calculator]** → ai.cmo.so/tools/roi-calculator

Quick preview:
- Manual content creation: 6 hours/week → £1,200/month (at £50/hour)
- aiCMO MOMENTUM: £111/month (with your discount)
- **You save £1,089/month + get 16x more content**

**3. "I'm not sure which plan to choose."**

Here's my recommendation:
- **Start with MOMENTUM** if you're a solopreneur or small team (most LDF25 attendees choose this)
- **Upgrade to OUTREACH** if you need social posts + email integration + priority support
- You can always switch plans (no lock-in, cancel anytime)

**Common Questions I'm Hearing:**

**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**
A: Yes. No contracts, no lock-in. Cancel with 2 clicks.

**Q: What if the content doesn't match my brand voice?**
A: We train Maggie on your existing content. Plus, you get a dedicated brand knowledge base to fine-tune tone, style, and messaging.

**Q: Will this actually get me cited by ChatGPT?**
A: We've seen 89% of MOMENTUM users get their first AI citation within 30 days. But we can't guarantee specific results (no one can).

**Q: Can I start with CATALYST and upgrade later?**
A: Absolutely. But you'll lose your 30% LDF25 discount (it expires tonight).

**Still have questions?** Reply to this email. I read every single one.

**Ready to upgrade?** Use code **LDF25-STANDARD** before midnight tonight:

**[CTA: Upgrade to MOMENTUM (30% Off - Last Chance)]** → ai.cmo.so/ldf25/momentum?code=LDF25-STANDARD

**[CTA: Upgrade to OUTREACH (30% Off - Last Chance)]** → ai.cmo.so/ldf25/outreach?code=LDF25-STANDARD

After tonight, your discount drops to 20% (and Maggie's Inner Circle access disappears).

Let's do this together.

Jason
Co-founder & CEO, aiCMO

P.S. If budget is tight, reply with "PAYMENT PLAN" and I'll set up a custom quarterly billing option for you.

**Subject:** [LDF25] What's happening in the WhatsApp group this week

Hi [First Name],

Have you checked the **Leeds Digital Festival WhatsApp group** lately?

It's been incredible watching the community come alive:

**This week's highlights:**

**Monday:** Tom (MOMENTUM user) shared his first ChatGPT citation screenshot - his sustainable tech consultancy was recommended in response to "best carbon-neutral IT solutions UK"

**Wednesday:** Live "Ask Maggie Anything" session - 47 attendees, 2 hours of Q&A on GEO strategy, content calendars, and AI citation optimization

**Friday:** Emma (OUTREACH user) posted her 30-day results - 1,200 articles published, 89 AI citations, 34% traffic increase, 8 inbound leads

**This is what happens when next-gen brands support each other.**

If you haven't joined yet, you're missing out:

**The 7-Day AI Citation Challenge:**

**Day 3-4:** Optimize it for GEO:
- Add a TL;DR section at the top
- Include 3-5 FAQs at the bottom
- Use clear H2/H3 structure
- Cite 2-3 authoritative sources

**Day 5:** Publish + submit to Google via Search Console

**Day 6-7:** Test if AI systems cite you:
- Ask ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude the same question
- See if they mention your brand or article

**This is how you start getting discovered by AI.**

Want to scale this 100x? That's what Maggie does on MOMENTUM (500 articles/month, all GEO-optimized).
