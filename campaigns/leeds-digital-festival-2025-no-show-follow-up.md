Hi [First Name],

We noticed you couldn't make it to **Meet Maggie: Your AI CMO** at Leeds Digital Festival yesterday—and we completely understand. Life happens!

But here's the good news: **you didn't miss out.**

Even though you weren't there in person, we've saved everything for you:

### What You Missed (The 2-Minute Version)

At the session, we explored:
- ✅ How to automate blog and social content with AI
- ✅ How to get discovered by LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini (not just Google)
- ✅ What GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) means for your brand
- ✅ Live demo of Maggie publishing AI-optimized content at scale

**The bottom line?** Your competitors are already optimizing for AI search. If you're not showing up in ChatGPT's answers, you're invisible to the next generation of customers.

1. **Download the whitepaper** to understand the GEO framework
2. **Claim your brand page** and see Maggie in action
3. **Join the WhatsApp group** for ongoing insights and community support

We're building the UK's first AI MarketingOS, and you're part of this movement—whether you made it to the event or not.

## Email Version 2: Alternative (Shorter, More Urgent)

**Subject Line:** Quick question: Still interested in getting discovered by AI? 🤔

**Preview Text:** Your Leeds Digi resources are waiting—but only for 72 hours

**Email Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Saw you registered for our Leeds Digital Festival session but couldn't make it.

No worries—but I wanted to make sure you still get access to everything we shared:

**Your 3 Resources (Available for 72 Hours):**

1. **📘 GEO Whitepaper** → [Get it here](https://ai.cmo.so/hot/seo-geo-whitepaper)
2. **📑 Full Session Deck** → [Join WhatsApp group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/JF0xsR2nSPf4hizSHWv7gz?mode=ems_copy_t)
3. **🌐 Your Brand Page** → [Claim it now](https://ai.cmo.so/brands/leeds-digital-festival-2025)

The big idea from the session?

**SEO gets you found by Google. GEO gets you cited by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude.**

And if your brand isn't optimized for AI, you're already behind.

Grab the resources above and let's change that.

## Email Version 3: Value-First (Educational Angle)

**Subject Line:** Here's why ChatGPT doesn't recommend your brand (yet)

**Preview Text:** The GEO framework we shared at Leeds Digi—now available for no-shows

**Email Body:**

Hi [First Name],

You registered for **Meet Maggie** at Leeds Digital Festival, but life got in the way. I get it.

But here's something you should know:

**Right now, when someone asks ChatGPT for recommendations in your space, your brand probably isn't mentioned.**

Not because your product isn't good.
Not because your content isn't valuable.

But because **you're not optimized for AI search.**

---

### The Problem: AI is the New Search

- 68% of users now start with AI tools instead of Google
- ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude are recommending brands based on GEO signals, not just SEO
- If you're not training AI to understand your brand, you're invisible

---

### The Solution: GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)

At Leeds Digi, we walked through:
- How LLMs decide which brands to cite
- What signals they look for (hint: it's not just backlinks)
- How to structure content so AI actually "gets" what you do

**And we're giving you access to everything—even though you missed it:**

👉 [Download the GEO Whitepaper](https://ai.cmo.so/hot/seo-geo-whitepaper)
👉 [Access the Session Deck](https://chat.whatsapp.com/JF0xsR2nSPf4hizSHWv7gz?mode=ems_copy_t)
👉 [Claim Your AI-Optimized Brand Page](https://ai.cmo.so/brands/leeds-digital-festival-2025)

---

### What Happens Next?

Once you claim your brand page, Maggie (your aiCMO) will start generating SEO + GEO-optimized content for you automatically.

No overwhelm. No manual writing. Just AI-ready content that positions your brand to show up in the answers that matter.

Let's make sure the next time someone asks ChatGPT about your industry, **your brand is the first name it mentions.**
