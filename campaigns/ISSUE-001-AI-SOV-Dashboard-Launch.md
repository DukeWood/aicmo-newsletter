## Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks

- **Owner:** Technical team + Peter (monitoring)
- **Contingency:** Staged rollout if issues detected, apologize quickly and offer extended trial

**Risk 2: AI Engine API Limitations**
- **Impact:** Cannot reliably track citations across all 5 AI platforms
- **Probability:** Low-Medium
- **Mitigation:** Set expectations clearly (beta feature, improving over time), focus on platforms with stable APIs
- **Owner:** Product team
- **Contingency:** Transparent communication about limitations, roadmap for improvements

### Market Risks

**Risk 3: Competitive Response from Writesonic/Azoma**
- **Impact:** Competitors launch similar features or aggressive counter-positioning
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Move fast, establish thought leadership first, emphasize full-stack OS advantage
- **Owner:** Brenda (messaging agility) + Mark (competitive monitoring)
- **Contingency:** Pivot messaging to orchestration/automation vs. point features, emphasize Maggie differentiator

**Risk 4: Low Market Awareness of AI SOV Concept**
- **Impact:** Prospects don't understand the value, messaging doesn't resonate
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Heavy pre-launch education, use analogy "Google Analytics for AI", show concrete examples
- **Owner:** Chris (educational content) + Sophie (community education)

### Execution Risks

**Risk 5: Cross-Agent Coordination Failures**

- **Probability:** Low
- **Mitigation:** Warm-up sending domain, test emails to multiple providers, monitor bounce/spam rates
- **Owner:** Emily (email-marketer)
- **Contingency:** Segment and re-send from different domain, increase social/organic promotion

**Risk 7: Launch Fatigue / Message Saturation**
- **Impact:** Audience tunes out aggressive launch promotion
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Value-first approach, educational content mixed with promo, respect frequency caps
- **Owner:** Sophie (engagement monitoring) + Emily (email frequency)
- **Contingency:** Reduce frequency if engagement drops, shift to more educational/helpful content

### Budget Risks

**Risk 8: Paid Promotion Costs Exceed Budget**
- **Impact:** CAC rises above £100 target, reducing ROI
