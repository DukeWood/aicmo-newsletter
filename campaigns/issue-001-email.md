## Strategic Positioning

### "Google Analytics for AI" Positioning
The campaign uses this simple, powerful analogy to explain the AI Share of Voice Dashboard:

**Primary Message:**
"AI CMO's AI Share of Voice Dashboard is Google Analytics for the AI era - track how often your brand is cited across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, and DeepSeek, understand what prompts trigger your mentions, and optimize your content to become the brand AI agents recommend."

### Competitive Differentiation
- **vs. Azoma:** Similar GEO capabilities but self-serve pricing vs. enterprise sales
- **vs. Writesonic:** Full marketing OS vs. AI writer + visibility addon
- **vs. Scalenut/SEO tools:** GEO-native by design vs. SEO-first with GEO bolted on
- **vs. Similarweb:** Execute marketing, not just benchmark it

### Unique Value Props
1. **Visibility Tracking:** Real-time citations across 5 major AI engines
2. **Prompt Intelligence:** Understand what questions lead to brand mentions
3. **Competitive Benchmarking:** Compare AI SOV to up to 5 competitors
4. **Optimization Guidance:** AI-driven recommendations to improve citations
5. **Historical Trending:** Track AI visibility improvements over time

## Risk Management

### Top Risks & Mitigations

**Technical Risks:**
- Dashboard performance issues at scale → Load testing, CDN optimization, staged rollout
- AI engine API limitations → Set clear expectations, transparent roadmap

**Market Risks:**
- Competitive response from Writesonic/Azoma → Move fast, emphasize orchestration advantage
- Low market awareness of AI SOV concept → Heavy education, "Google Analytics for AI" analogy

**Execution Risks:**
- Cross-agent coordination failures → Daily standups, clear RACI matrix, Maggie oversight
- Email deliverability issues → Domain warm-up, multi-provider testing, bounce monitoring
- Launch fatigue / message saturation → Value-first approach, frequency caps, engagement monitoring

**Budget Risks:**
- Paid promotion costs exceed budget → Organic focus, careful paid testing, daily CAC tracking
