## Tips for Best Results with DALL-E 3

### General Tips:
1. **Be specific about dimensions** - Always include pixel dimensions in prompt
2. **Specify color codes** - Use exact hex codes for brand consistency
3. **Reference style examples** - Mention brands like "HubSpot," "Stripe," "Lenny's Newsletter"
4. **Request "professional email newsletter" aesthetic** - Helps DALL-E understand context
5. **Ask for "clean, modern SaaS design"** - Sets the right visual tone

### If DALL-E adds unwanted elements:
- Add "no additional decorative elements" to prompt
- Request "minimalist design only"
- Specify "clean white background, no textures"

### If text looks wrong:
- DALL-E sometimes struggles with text - you may need to:
  - Regenerate 2-3 times to get clean text
  - Use a design tool to add text overlay after generation
  - Request "bold, clear, readable text" in prompt

### Color accuracy:
- Always include hex codes (e.g., #C8102E)
- Request "exact color match to hex code provided"
- Ask for "high contrast for email readability"

### File optimization after generation:
1. Download PNG from ChatGPT
2. Use TinyPNG.com or similar to compress
