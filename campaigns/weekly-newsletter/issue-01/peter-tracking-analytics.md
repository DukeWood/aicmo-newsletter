## A/B Testing Framework

### Test Configuration (Issue #1)

**Test Variable:** Subject Line
**Test Size:** 20% of subscriber list (10% Variant A, 10% Variant B)
**Winner Selection:** After 2 hours based on open rate
**Winner Distribution:** Remaining 80% of list receives winning subject line

### Subject Line Variants

**Variant A (Data-Driven):**
```
Subject: "71% of your customers now use AI to find brands"
Preview: "But ChatGPT only cites 2-7 companies. Here's how to be one of them."
Character Count: 49 chars (subject) + 70 chars (preview)
```

**Variant B (Provocative Question):**
```
Subject: "Discovery moved. Have you?"
Preview: "400M people ask ChatGPT to recommend brands every week. Is yours mentioned?"
Character Count: 27 chars (subject) + 77 chars (preview)
```

**Control (Remaining 80% after A/B test):**
Automatically uses whichever variant (A or B) achieves higher open rate in first 2 hours.

### A/B Test Metrics to Track

| Metric | Variant A | Variant B | Winner |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Open Rate | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| Click-Through Rate | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| Conversion Rate | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| Unsubscribe Rate | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |

**Decision Criteria:**
- Primary: Open Rate (determines winner for remaining 80%)
- Secondary: CTR (indicates content-subject alignment)
- Tertiary: Conversion Rate (ultimate business metric)

**Hypothesis:**
- **Variant A (Data-Driven):** Expected to perform better with analytical founders who respond to statistics
- **Variant B (Provocative):** Expected to perform better with time-starved founders who want quick insights

## Conversion Funnel Tracking

### Full Funnel (Email → Signup)

```
[Email Sent]
    ↓
[Email Opened] (Open Rate)
    ↓
[Link Clicked] (CTR)
    ↓
[Landing Page Viewed] (Click→View Rate)
    ↓
[Signup Form Started] (View→Start Rate)
    ↓
[Signup Completed] (Start→Complete Rate)
```

### Key Conversion Points

**Stage 1: Email → Open**
- **Metric:** Open Rate
- **Target:** 35% (Week 1 baseline), 40% (Week 4 target)
- **Tracking:** Mailchimp native tracking
- **Optimization Lever:** Subject line, sender name, send time

**Stage 2: Open → Click**
- **Metric:** Click-Through Rate (CTR)
- **Target:** 5% (Week 1 baseline), 8% (Week 4 target)
- **Tracking:** Mailchimp + Google Analytics (UTM)
- **Optimization Lever:** Content relevance, CTA clarity, link placement

**Stage 3: Click → Landing Page View**
- **Metric:** Click-to-View Rate
- **Target:** 80%+ (should be near 100% unless technical issues)
- **Tracking:** Google Analytics (referral → landing page)
- **Optimization Lever:** Landing page load speed, mobile optimization

**Stage 4: Landing Page → Form Start**
- **Metric:** View-to-Start Rate
- **Target:** 25%+ (industry standard for B2B)
- **Tracking:** Google Analytics (event tracking on form field focus)
- **Optimization Lever:** Value proposition clarity, form placement, friction reduction

**Stage 5: Form Start → Signup Complete**
- **Metric:** Start-to-Complete Rate
- **Target:** 70%+ (minimize form abandonment)
- **Tracking:** Google Analytics (event tracking on form submission)
- **Optimization Lever:** Form length, required fields, error handling

**Overall Conversion (Email → Signup):**
- **Calculation:** Open Rate × CTR × View-to-Start × Start-to-Complete
- **Target:** 2%+ overall conversion (email sent → completed signup)
- **Example:** 40% open × 8% CTR × 25% view-to-start × 70% complete = 0.56% (conservative)
- **With 1,000 subscribers:** 5-6 signups per issue (baseline), scaling to 10+ by Week 4
