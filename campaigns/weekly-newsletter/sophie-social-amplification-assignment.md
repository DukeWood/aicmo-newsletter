## Assignment Owner
Sophie (social-media-manager)

## Assignment from
Maggie (aiCMO)

## Objective
Review newsletter content for authentic brand voice, create compelling social media teasers to drive newsletter signups and engagement, and identify community engagement opportunities across platforms.

## Dependencies
- Emily's newsletter copy: `/Users/Jason-uk/AI/AI_Coding/Repositories/TorlyAI_v2/campaigns/weekly-newsletter/2025-01-13-issue-01.md`
- Chris's editorial brief: `/Users/Jason-uk/AI/AI_Coding/Repositories/TorlyAI_v2/campaigns/weekly-newsletter/chris-editorial-brief.md`
- Brand knowledge: `/Users/Jason-uk/AI/AI_Coding/Repositories/TorlyAI_v2/knowledge_base/brand/`

## Assignment Context

This is the launch of aiCMO's weekly newsletter - a critical brand touchpoint that needs to feel authentic, engaging, and aligned with how our community communicates. Your role combines quality assurance (voice/tone) with amplification strategy (social promotion).

### Target Platforms
- **Primary**: LinkedIn (professional audience, thought leadership)
- **Secondary**: Twitter/X (real-time engagement, AI/tech community)
- **Tertiary**: Reddit (r/marketing, r/startups, r/entrepreneur - community discussions)
- **Emerging**: Bluesky (early adopter audience)

## Deliverable Requirements

Create: `/Users/Jason-uk/AI/AI_Coding/Repositories/TorlyAI_v2/campaigns/weekly-newsletter/sophie-social-strategy.md`

### Part 1: Voice & Authenticity Review

Review Emily's newsletter copy for:

#### Brand Voice Alignment Check
- **Visionary**: Does it paint a compelling future of AI-first marketing?
- **Empowering**: Does it make challenger brands feel capable, not overwhelmed?
- **Futuristic**: Does it feel cutting-edge without being inaccessible?
- **Human-centric**: Does it balance AI talk with human warmth?
- **Data-informed**: Does it cite credible sources and insights?

#### Authenticity Audit
- Does the tone feel like a "smart, supportive CMO" (not salesy, not academic)?
- Are complex ideas explained simply?
- Does it inspire and activate (not just inform)?
- Is the 80/20 balance maintained (educational vs. promotional)?
- Does it feel conversation-worthy (would you share it)?

#### Recommendations
Provide:
- 3-5 specific copy adjustments (if needed) with rationale
- "Voice Score" (1-10) with justification
- Suggestions to enhance authenticity or engagement
- Any cultural/trend alignment opportunities
