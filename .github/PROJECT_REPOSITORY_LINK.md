   - ‚úÖ `read:project` (Read access to projects)

   - **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again!)

5. **Add to Repository Secrets**
   - Go to: https://github.com/DukeWood/aicmo-newsletter/settings/secrets/actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT`

## ‚úÖ Verify Connection

### Test 1: Check Existing Issues
```bash
# List project items (should show 9 issues)
gh project item-list 2 --owner DukeWood --format json | jq '.items[].content.title'
```

### Test 2: Create Test Issue
```bash
# Create a test issue
gh issue create --repo DukeWood/aicmo-newsletter \
  --title "[TEST] Verify Project Auto-Link" \
  --body "This is a test issue to verify automatic project linking."

# Check if it appears in project within 30 seconds
gh project item-list 2 --owner DukeWood | grep TEST
```

### Test 3: Check Workflow Runs
```bash
# View recent workflow runs
gh run list --repo DukeWood/aicmo-newsletter --workflow "Add to Project"
```

## üîÑ How It Works

### When You Create an Issue:

1. **Issue created** in repository
   ```bash
   gh issue create --repo DukeWood/aicmo-newsletter --title "New task"
   ```

2. **Workflow triggers** (`.github/workflows/add-to-project.yml`)
   - Detects new issue event
   - Authenticates with `ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT`

3. **Issue added to project** automatically
   - Appears in project board within seconds
   - Status set to "Todo" (default)
   - Ready for custom field assignment

4. **You can then:**
   - Assign Agent, Component, Priority, etc.
   - Move between Status columns
   - Add to Sprint

### When You Create a PR:

Same workflow applies to pull requests:
1. PR opened
2. Workflow triggers
3. PR added to project
4. Linked to related issues automatically

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue Not Auto-Added to Project

**Check:**
1. Is `ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT` secret configured?
   - Go to: https://github.com/DukeWood/aicmo-newsletter/settings/secrets/actions
   - Verify `ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT` exists

2. Is the workflow enabled?
   ```bash
   gh workflow view "Add to Project" --repo DukeWood/aicmo-newsletter
   ```

3. Check workflow run logs:
   ```bash
   gh run list --repo DukeWood/aicmo-newsletter --workflow "Add to Project"
   gh run view <run-id> --log
   ```

### PAT Expired

If your PAT expires:
1. Generate new token (same steps as above)
2. Update `ADD_TO_PROJECT_PAT` secret with new token
3. Test by creating a new issue

### Workflow Failed

Common causes:
- Missing or invalid PAT
- Insufficient PAT permissions
- Project URL incorrect in workflow file
- GitHub Actions disabled in repository

**Solution:**
1. Check workflow file: `.github/workflows/add-to-project.yml`
2. Verify project URL: `https://github.com/users/DukeWood/projects/2`
3. Regenerate PAT with correct scopes
4. Update secret

  --url "https://github.com/DukeWood/aicmo-newsletter/issues/ISSUE_NUMBER"

# Add multiple issues
for issue in 10 11 12; do
  gh project item-add 2 --owner DukeWood \
    --url "https://github.com/DukeWood/aicmo-newsletter/issues/$issue"
done
```
