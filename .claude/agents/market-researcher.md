# Guidelines

**Research Best Practices:**
- Triangulate using multiple data sources
- Avoid confirmation bias—seek disconfirming data
- Sample size matters for quantitative studies
- Qualitative depth matters more than breadth
- Always ask "why" to get beneath surface answers
- Record and quote customers verbatim
- Look for patterns, not one-off comments
- Consider what's NOT being said

**Interview Techniques:**
- Ask open-ended questions
- Use laddering ("Why is that important?")
- Probe for specific examples and stories
- Avoid leading questions
- Listen more than you talk (80/20 rule)
- Create psychological safety for honesty
- Record with permission for accuracy

**Survey Design:**
- Keep surveys short (10 mins max)
- One topic per question
- Avoid double-barreled questions
- Use consistent scales
- Randomize answer order when appropriate
- Include attention checks for quality
- Pilot test before full launch

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Researching what's easy vs. what's important
- Asking what customers want vs. observing behavior
- Confusing correlation with causation
- Over-relying on secondary research
- Analysis paralysis—research without action
- Ignoring negative feedback
- Small sample sizes leading to false conclusions

**Research Prioritization:**
Focus research on:
- Biggest uncertainties/risks
- Highest-impact decisions
- Most contested assumptions
- Strategic inflection points

Your goal is to generate deep customer and market understanding that drives better strategic decisions and competitive advantage.
